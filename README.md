# Exploring FBI Gun Data

## Introduction

The dataset that I have chosen to investigate is the FBI Gun Dataset. The FBI Gun Dataset provides data from gun ownership and permits from all States in the United States of America and also American territories such as Guama and Puerto Rico. The questions I will be exploring in this dataset are "Which States have had the highest growth in gun registrations?" and "What is the overall trend of gun purchases?"

## Summary of Findings

The number of growth permits were the highest in Kentucky with 37,000 permits being issued. This is followed by California then Texas, with over 5,000 and under 5,000, respectively. Texas has the most hand gun purchases, and they own multiple guns, they are the State that buys pre-pawn guns the most and also undergoes the most redemptions compared to other States. New York is the State that has the most hand gun and long gun rentals, also they return hand and long guns to the seller more than any other State. There are no permits issued in Guam, this may be because they have a lack of records or people are owning guns illegally. Hawaii has the lowest amount of hand guns, long guns, and multiple guns. California has the lowest number of pre-pawned guns, private sales of guns, and returned to the seller. To look into more detail, States were compared in terms of redeemed guns, privately purchased guns, and pre-pawned guns. For the majority of all States, long guns were more popular than handguns and other guns. Only a small fraction of people in the United States have multiple guns. There are a few exceptions where purchasing a handgun was more popular which includes Florida, Arizona, Ohio, Tennessee. For private gun selling, Washington and New York had the most sold handguns around 2,000 and 1,500 handguns, respectively. The majority of redeemed guns in each State were long guns which is expected because the most popular guns that have been purchased were long guns. For pre-pawn guns, the majority of the guns in each State were long guns were Texas and Mississippi were close to 1,000 purchases.

To gather more information with gun statistics, it would have been great to know why long guns were more popular than hand guns. Are guns in the United States of America used for hunting? Is it mostly used for protection and long guns are more threatening to invaders? Who buys guns in general? What is their race, age, and educational backgrounds? Some permits were recorded as 0 in States such as Guama for example, does this mean that they have guns illegally or do they not have the means to record this data? These questions could've been answered but there were limited data that could provide us with these answers.

## Learning Outcomes

* Learned all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process.
* Asked questions within a given dataset and answered those questions.
* Investigated problems within the dataset and wrangled the data into a format that I could use.
* Communicated my results from the analysis.
* Used vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas to speed up my data analysis code.
* Familiarized myself with using Pandas and Dataframe objects, which let me access my data more conveniently. 
* Created plots in Matplotlib to show my findings.
